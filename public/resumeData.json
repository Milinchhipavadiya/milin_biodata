Born in a small town in Northern BC, I made my move to Victoria where I work as a full stack developer for Instant Domain Search, alongside my many ongoing projects. I love to create and tend to keep a few too many projects on the go at a time. Outside of work I am an avid motorcyclist, soccer player and Muay Thai fighter. I love to travel and lead a fairly nomadic lifestyle. I built much of my early portfolio from beaches of Southeast Asia and dream of being able to take my work with me while travelling the world.",

I worked as a water meter technician programming the meters in people's homes. I worked in location, excavation, installation and repair of water and sewer lines. I learned how to install, dismantle, troubleshoot, and repair the most popular models of fire hydrants. \n\nWhile working for the Water Treatment and Distribution Department, and alongside one partner, we led the first Uni-Directional Flow program our city has done in years. This requires a thorough understanding of the city's water grid to selectively force excessive pressure through a water line in order to clean it. This must be done in a specific order for every line in the city.   "
